# discord-mini
Discord CSS Theme that makes everything more compact.

If the window size is less than 960px it will change its style to a more compact version. If it's less than 480px then the server and channel panels will disappear! (See in preview)

## Installation

Add the following code lines to `...\AppData\Roaming\discord\settings.json`:
```json
"MIN_WIDTH": 480, "MIN_HEIGHT": 440
```

Either use [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord), [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) or [DiscordInjections](https://github.com/DiscordInjections/DiscordInjections) to apply the theme. They have their theme installation tutorials... I think.
